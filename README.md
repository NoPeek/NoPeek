# About NoPeek

NoPeek is an iOS application built with the Lynx frontend framework, designed to protect users‚Äô privacy when sharing photos on social media.  
The app leverages AI-powered detection and obfuscation to automatically identify sensitive information‚Äîsuch as faces, license plates, ID cards, and location clues‚Äîand applies customizable protection (blur, pixelation, emoji replacement).

- üîç **AI Detection**: Automatically detects faces, license plates, and documents objects on photos.
- üõ° **Multiple Privacy Protection Modes**: Provides blur, emoji substitution, and generative AI-based transformations.
- üì± **Native iOS Experience**: Built with the Lynx framework for smooth and responsive performance.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **On-device Processing**: Local real-time detection and protection to safeguard user privacy.
- üì§ **Easy Social Media Integration**: Seamlessly connects with social media apps, allowing one-tap posting of privacy-protected photos directly to TikTok.
